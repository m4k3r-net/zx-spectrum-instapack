Unit Clock;
{
  Author:  Trevor J Carlsen
  Purpose: Demonstrate a simple "on screen" clock.

  This demo Unit works by "hooking" the timer interrupt ($1c). This
  interrupt is called by the hardware interrupt ($08) approximately 18.2
  times every second and normally consists of a simple return instruction
  unless some other application has already hooked it.

  Because the routine is called roughly 18 times every second it is
  important that any processing it contains is optimised as much as
  possible.  Obviously the best way to do this is by assembly language but
  in this demo I have used almost pure Turbo Pascal and have set up a
  counter Variable and any processing is only done every 6 calls.  This is
  more than sufficient and minimises processing. The routine is by no
  means perfect - there will be a minor irregularity For the final 10
  seconds of each day and For about half a second each hour. Better this
  than to waste valuable processing time in the interrupt by coding it
  out.

  Because Dos is not re-entrant it is also important that the routine make
  no calls to any Procedure or Function that makes use of Dos For its
  operation. Thus no Writeln, Write can be used.  To display the time on
  screen an Array is addressed directly to screen memory.  Any changes in
  this Array are thus reflected on the screen.  The downside to this is
  that on older CGAs this would cause a "snow" effect and code would be
  needed to eliminate this. It also means that the TP Procedure GetTime
  cannot be used.  So the time is calculated from the value stored at the
  clock tick counter location.

  To display an on-screen clock all that is required is For a Programmer
  to include this Unit in the Uses declaration of the Program.}
