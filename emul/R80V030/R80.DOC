 1.2 - Contents of the distribution
 ----------------------------------

        cwsdpmi.exe      - Needed by r80.exe, you can delete it if you
                           already have it in your path.(20473 bytes)
        r80.exe          - R80 executable. (222352 bytes)
        r80.doc          - R80 documentation.
        48.rom           - Spectrum 48k ROM.
        128.rom          - Spectrum 128k ROM.
        plus2.rom        - Spectrum +2 ROM.
        plus3.rom        - Spectrum +2A, +3 ROM.
        pentagon.rom     - Pentagon 128 ROM.

      About the roms: Amstrad allow free distribution of roms for emulation
  purposes.

      About Multiface 128: Multiface rom is not included in this
  distribution. You have to get it from somewhere else and rename it
  to 'mf128.rom' or change the name in r80.ini.

  Do NOT distribute with anything else.


 1.3 - System requirements
 -------------------------

    R80 runs under DOS, Windows 95/98 DOS box and has been reported
  to work under OS/2. When running in a Windows 95/98 DOS box it takes
  advantage of long filenames. Due to the changes done in version
  0.20 I don't know exactly what are the minimum requirements to run R80,
  but I think a Pentium 100 with about 8Mb of memory should be enough. A
  Sound Blaster, Adlib or Gravis sound card is required for AY-3-8912
  emulation. A VGA video card is required and VESA 2.0+ recommended.

    In slow computers (386 and 486) you will see a blank screen. In a 386
  better leave it and go for another emulator. In a 486 you can try to set
  a high frame rate value and at least you will see something.


 1.4 - How you can help me
 -------------------------

    No, I'm not going to ask you money. The best way of helping me is
  testing games, programs,... and mailing me if you find something
  not working.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 3 - Configuration
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 3.1 - r80.ini 
 -------------

    The emulator searches this file in the path or in the current directory.
  If found it loads default settings of the emulator.

    See r80.ini for the list of options and valid values of each one.

 3.2 - keyboard.ini
 ------------------

    This file is used to customize the keyboard. You can set any
  key of a Spectrum 48k to a PC key. Also you can map any combination
  of key + Symbol Shift or Caps Shift to a single key of PC keyboard.

    See keyboard.ini for a description on how to configure this file.

    Also I have done a small program that detects scan codes from the
  keyboard. You can use it to find the scan code of any key of your
  keyboard. Download from http://www.chaosite.com/r80

 3.3 - Command line
 ------------------

    Command line options overwrite settings of r80.ini. Use r80.exe -h to
  see all available options.

 5 - Tips & Hints
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Fileselector (Screenshot): When you select a file, R80 tries to find
  a screenshot (SCR) of this file to show in the right window of the
  fileselector. The screenshot must have exactly the same name as the file,
  except for the extension that must be SCR. R80 tries to find it in a
  directory of current directory named SCRSHOT or in the directory selected
  in r80.ini

  * Fileselector (Game/Program info): When you select a file, R80 tries
  to find information of this program/game to show in lower window of
  fileselector. To get this information, R80 loads at startup the SGD's
  DAT files selected in r80.ini. So get SGD and start filling the info
  for your favorites games/programs.

  * ZIP/RAR: R80 has support for ZIP/RAR compressed files. The only R80 needs
  is pkzip.exe and rar.exe in your PATH to unpack them. If you have files
  compressed with long filenames you need PKZIP 2.50 and run R80 in a
  Windows 95/98 DOS box.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 6 - Known bugs
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * In Adlib, there is not noise pseudo-frequency emulation. Low envelope
    periods (<#0200) are not played right.

  * Even screen updating is now 32T, there are still some programs that
    require more accurate screen update.

  * There are other minor bugs here and there that you will never notice,
    so I save them for myself :)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 7 - To Do
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This list shows what are my plans for next versions, in the order I want
  to do them, but it may change at any time. Also, it shows status of them:

    * Fix all bugs. (done, R80 has no bugs :))
    * Perfect screen update, with complete rewrite of screen code, including
      GUI. (still thinking how to do the perfect screen update)
    * Complete rewrite of timing control for tape and disk emulation.
      Emulation should be faster and I will have more control for
      devices timing. (I have the idea, must be implemented)
    * General Sound emulation. (reading docs and thinking how to add)

    Other things in no order.

    * Sound saving (WAV (coded, missing GUI), PSG (needs fixing and GUI)
      and other formats)
    * Spectrum +3 emulation, DSK emulation (I read some docs, delayed)
    * Finish Betadisk emulation. (Waiting for rewrite of timing control)
    * Disciple, +D emulation. (Waiting for rewrite of timing control)
    * AY and AMX mouse support. (I may add at any time, AY should not be much
      time)
    * Adding new GUI options
    * Interface 1, Microdrive support.
    * Pentagon and Scorpion extra video modes (Waiting for screen code
      rewrite)
    * Sam Coupe emulation (I read some docs)
    * Timex Sinclair emulation (I read some docs).

    Future projects (2010 or so): port R80 to Linux and even Win32.

 8 - Greetings
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      * Isaac Santaolalla: many thanks for GUS routines, fixing pitch
      in my adlib routines :), ideas , comments, showing me how slow
      r80 runs in his DX2-66 :) and everything else (que no es poco :)).
      Check his MSX emulator 'MSKISS', it is the best (and only?) spanish
      MSX emulator.

      * Mac Buster: many thanks for your help with Betadisk and Petagon,
      and for the lot of ideas of what could be nice to add to R80 :).
      Also many thanks for taking the risk to test beta versions of R80 ;)

      * Random: many thanks for your info about Scorpion, your ideas for
      debugger and for testing beta version of R80.

      * Ricardo Bittencourt: many thanks for your source code for SB
      playback, even I finally did my own routines.

      * Gerardo Oporto Jorrin: thanks for testing and ideas for the emulator.

      * Steve Smith: thanks for the info about tape loaders and ideas for
      the debugger and emulator.

      * Alex Krasivsky and Marat Fayzullin: I used some of their Adlib init
      routines to get a better sound output.

      * Jose Manuel Claros: thanks for your support and feedback. Check his
      World of Spectrum site at http://www.arrakis.es/~tecnilin

      * Microhobby: Old spanish Spectrum mag which released a great book and
      cards about the Z80 assembler. It had some bugs, but of great help at
      the very beginning of development.

      * Phillip Kendall: thanks for the info I got from the CSS FAQ.

      * Gerton Lunter: thanks for the technical info included with Z80.

      * Sean Young: thanks for the great collection of undocumented
      features of the Z80.
